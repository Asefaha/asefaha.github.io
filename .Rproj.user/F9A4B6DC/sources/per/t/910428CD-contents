Hi, I'm Feven Asefaha. I'm about to earn my MS in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics).

Before that, I worked as a biologist for New York City's [Dept. of Health & Mental Hygiene](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page).

I enjoy working with data, creating informative visualizations, and communicating concepts to the 
unfamiliar.

I obtained my BS from Cornell University in 2015. While I was there, I worked on research regarding 
collective decision making in social insects.
